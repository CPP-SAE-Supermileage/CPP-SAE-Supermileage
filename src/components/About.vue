    <p class="paragraph font-weight-regular">
      The California Polytechnic University, Pomona SAE Supermileage club has two teams, engineering and computer
      science.
      The engineering team maintains and helps with the designs of the car, cfd, engineering reports for competition.
      The computer science team works on the hardware for the autonomous systems, machine learning for navigation, and
      computer vision.

      <span class="tab">CPP SAE Supermileage was founded to engineer the most fuel</span>
      efficient vehicles to fight against the climate change. Although it’s established in Fall
      2018, the team built the Cal Poly Pomona’s first ever super fuel efficient
      vehicle, Moonshot, from scratch in little bit over a year with no prior experience. CPP
      SAE Supermileage designs, analyzes and manufactures its own aerodynamic shell,
      chassis, steering system and power control units in house with funds from sponsors
      and donors, almost entirely. In an attempt to create the ultimate fuel efficiency
      machine, the team decided to embrace the latest developments in machine learning,
      computer vision, sensor fusion and autonomous driving, and formed into an
      engineering+computer science driven organization in early 2020.
