    <p class="paragraph font-weight-regular">
      The California Polytechnic University, Pomona SAE Supermileage club has two teams, engineering and computer
      science.
      The engineering team maintains and helps with the designs of the car, cfd, engineering reports for competition.
      The computer science team works on the hardware for the autonomous systems, machine learning for navigation, and
      computer vision.

      <span class="tab"/>Established in the fall of 2018, Cal. Poly Pomona's Society of Automotive Engineers Supermileage 
      was founded to engineer the most fuel efficient vehicles to fight against climate change. 
      Despite no prior experience, our team built Cal. Poly Pomonaâ€™s first ever super-fuel-efficient vehicle, Moonshot, 
      from scratch in just over a year. CPP SAE Supermileage designs, analyzes and manufactures its own aerodynamic shells,
      chassis, steering systems and power control units in-house with funds from sponsors
      and donors. To create the ultimate fuel efficient machine, our team has embraced the latest developments in machine learning,
      computer vision, sensor fusion and autonomous driving, forming into an
      engineering and computer science driven organization in early 2020.

      <span class="tab"/>Although primarily comprised of engineering and computer science students,
      we welcome any individual motivated to go the extra mile with us!
